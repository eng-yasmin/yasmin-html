 <strong>Usability and usefulness</strong>
 </h3>
 </li>
<h4>While it is difficult to make devices with small displays usable, there is also the fundamental challenge of making them useful. In this context, usefulness means that the application is beneficial and can help the end-users to achieve a particular goal, whereas good usability means that the application is easy and pleasant to use.
To achieve both goals, particularly for mobile devices, it is strongly recommended applying a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach( UCD) evolved in the field of HCI and was first articulated as such in User-Centered System Design and focuses strongly on the intended end-users.
