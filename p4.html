    <strong>Prototyping</strong>
  </h2>
<p> When designing an interface, designers are confronted with a dilemma: on the one hand, it is not possible to evaluate an interface until it is built; on the other hand, after it has been built, changes are difficult and expensive. One solution to surmounting this dilemma is prototyping. This means producing cost effective interactive versions of an interface design. Most of all, together with UE Methods, this enables to bring the end-user into the development process at a very early stage. Some general advantages of prototyping include reduction of development time and consequently a reduction of costs; facilitation of end-user involvement from the beginning, thus supporting user-centered development; facilitation of system implementation, since the end-users know what to expect, consequently resulting in higher end-user satisfaction. However, prototyping also presents some disadvantages: it might possibly lead to insufficient analysis, resulting in incomplete documentation; the end-users might expect the performance of the final system to be “identical” to the prototype; developers can become reluctant to modify their prototypes.</p>
