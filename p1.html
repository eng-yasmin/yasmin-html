<h4>Mobile computing as a challenge for universal access in the information society. Mobile computing as a challenge for universal accessin the information society Mobile Computing is an umbrella term and describes any technology that enables people to access information and which supports them in daily workflows independent of location. Actually, it is remarkable that many of the mobile computing research results and breakthroughs came from the Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI) field. However, there is still room for a great deal of progress in this extremely successful and worthwhile area of endeavor. The phenomenal growth of mobile computing, which has not been accompanied by an equivalent increase in the understanding of end-users for the complexities of this subject, has caused an increase in the need for research in mobile computing and a parallel campaign to increase the awareness and proficiency of the end-users.
Consequently, the area of mobile computing is a good example of the New Computing in the sense indicated by Ben Shneiderman: the new computing technologies must enable end-users to accomplish their tasks and to relax, enjoy, and explore.</h4>
